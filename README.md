# Devops2

This is feature Z. Doing thingz in a new wayz. Thiz iz the Final Product.

##### This Branch also contains a unit testing module


## Continuous Integration (CI) 

I have used Github Actions to automate the build process. As a build script file, there is `python-publish.yml` file on 
the folder [https://github.com/JeevanPaudel/Devops2/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml](https://github.com/JeevanPaudel/Devops2/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml) .

The Build script does following tasks:
* Sets up python on Ubuntu server
* Install Dependencies Required for the project
* Runs test from our unit testing python file


**The Build Script automatically runs when code is merged to the main branch**


Please let me know if you want to contribute to this project. 

Random Test
