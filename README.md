# Devops2

This is feature Z. We doing thingz in a new wayzzzz. Thiz iz the Final Product.

##### This Branch also contains a unit testing module


## Continuous Integration (CI) 

We have used Github Actions to automate our build process. As a build script file we have `python-publish.yml` file on 
the folder [https://github.com/JeevanPaudel/Devops2/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml](https://github.com/JeevanPaudel/Devops2/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-publish.yml) .

Our Build script does following tasks:
* Sets up python on Ubuntu server
* Install Dependencies Required for the project
* Runs test from our unit testing python file


**The Build Script automatically runs when we push code to the main branch**
